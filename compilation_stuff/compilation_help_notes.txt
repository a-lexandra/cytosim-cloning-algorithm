makefile.inc

path in git repo: compilation_stuff/

Relevant changes are in the following sections:

a. Compiler section:

line 92: -Isrc/extras flag: extra include directory which contains GL stuff (I'm pretty sure it actually relies on those files for OpenGL/GUI display stuff to work)

--> git repo path for extras folder: compilation_stuff/src/extras

b. Linux section:

line 234: BLASLIB directory
line 259: GRAFIX directory 
line 262: LIB_PNG directory

simul_report.cc

path in git repo:
compilation_stuff/src/sim

Need to uncomment code in the function starting on line 1640 - reportCoupleLink() - to return positions of hands in addition to the abscissae that define the cross-link

I think it's just lines 1648, 1649, 1661, 1665
