# Cytosim Cloning algorithm

## Current files:

- `cloning_cytosim.cpp`: main cloning algorithm file
- `read_link.cpp`: beginnings of a parser (that we will hopefully not need to write)
- `link.txt`: example of cytosim output file for cross-linkers linking two filaments
- `suri_code`: Suri's cloning code (for reference)
