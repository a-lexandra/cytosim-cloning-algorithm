## Meeting with Yuqing

- Looked deeper into Suri's cloning algorithm
	- When excess clones are deleted, the "extra" clones (those with index that is greater than $`N_c`$) seem to be more likely to be chosen to be deleted &rarr; need to make sure that deletion/cloning occurs uniformly
- Added example Cytosim scripts/files into repo
- Cloning algorithm design
	- Things that will be nice to implement
		- [ ] Output the number of clones prior to scaling the population down to $`N_c`$
		- [ ] Keep track of which clones are kept/cloned and which ones are discarded &rarr; recoring a clone's "lineage"
		- [ ] Provide "fresh" random seeds for each `config.cym` input file when restarting the simulation for a clone &rarr; see `random_seed` parameter in Cytosim
- Needs further consideration:
	- [ ] How to check for completion of a cloning step? (implementation)
	- [ ] How to manage directories of clones?
	- [ ] To decide cloning/deletion fate of clone, should we use $`\langle \dot{w} \rangle`$ for a cloning run or the $'\dot{w}'$ value for the last frame?
- [ ] Run 2D simulations of 5 clones as a test
	- Clone every 10 s (?)
- [ ] Need to finalize/test the expression for $'\dot{w}'$
