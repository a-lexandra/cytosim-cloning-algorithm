# 7 August 2020 progress/status update

Alexandra Lamtyugina

## Completed
- wDotIntegral calculator - `calculate` executable
	- Outputs:
		- `wDots.txt`: wDot values for each time frame
			- Format: `frame.timeStamp\tframe.wDot\n`
		- `wDotIntegral.txt`: for the whole trajectory
			- Recently modified the code to calculate the frame time stamp instead of directly extracting it from the output file.  The output file has limited precision for floating points
			- Format: `simul.wDotIntegral` (one line text file - only contains a single value)

## In progress
- Confirming the convergence of calculated wDotIntegral for various time steps and frame numbers
- Launching clones - `launch` executable


## TODO
- Controlling the population - `control` executable
- Increasing floating point precision in output file? - would like more than four decimal points
