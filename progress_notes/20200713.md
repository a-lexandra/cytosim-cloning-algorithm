# 13 July 2020 progress/status update

## Progress since last update

- Set up `git` repo and shared with Suri (https://psd-repo.uchicago.edu/alexandral/cytosim-cloning-algorithm.git)
  - Git Kraken GUI for git repositories
- Augmented compilation instructions in the `git` repository and assisted with compilation on cluster
- Discussed design options for cloning algorithm implementation
- Analyzed Cytosim source code to assess feasibility of implementation of cloning algorithm via two possible methods
  - Script &rarr; primary focus
  - Wrapper &rarr; secondary task
- Began writing code for cloning script (see current plan below)



## Current plan

Write script around Cytosim (instead of wrapper for the engine) to get cloning algorithm simulations going

1. C++ script calls Cytosim to launch several trajectories

    - [x] Already have the code for this (might modify to improve efficiency)

    - ```c++
      // from cloning_cytosim.cpp

      int launch_simulations() // seems to be done?
      {
      	/*
      	 * ✓ create separate directories
      	 * ✓ copies config.cym and cytosim.sbatch files
      	 * ✓ starts cytosim simulation via sbatch
      	 *
      	 * Return the number of clones for future use
      	 */

      	//Query the user for the number of clones/trajectories to simulate
      	int N_clones ;
      	std::cout << "Enter the number of trajectory copies (integer value):" << endl;
      	std::cin >> N_clones;

      	char buffer[255];

      	for (int i=0; i<N_clones; i++)
      	{
      		// Create string of shell commands and run the commands
      		std::sprintf(buffer, "mkdir -p sims/%03d; cp config.cym cytosim.sbatch sims/%03d; cd sims/%03d; pwd; sbatch cytosim.sbatch", i, i, i);
      		system(buffer);
      	}

      	return N_clones;
      }

      ```

2. Cytosim runs and outputs data
3. C++ script parses the output file

    - [ ] ==Item that needs most work==
4. C++ script calculates trajectory-dependent quantities

    - [ ] Similar to the code that Suri sent, will likely be able to reuse some of it
5. C++ script clones/deletes trajectories based on the quantities that were calculated  

    - [ ] Code similar to that for step 1, fairly straightforward. Almost done.
6. Repeat steps 2-5



## Pseudocode for `main` function

```c++
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Initialize clones and begin simulations
	int N_clones = launch_simulations();

    for (int i=0; i<N_cloning_epochs; i++)
    {
        // Check for completion of cloning epoch simulations for all clones
        check_simulations();

        // Process each clone
        for (int j=0; j<N_clones; j++)
        {
            // Change to clone directory

            // Parse the output file produced by Cytosim
            data = parse_output_file("file.txt");

            // Calculate thermodynamic quantities for trajectory
            thermo_quant = calculate_thermo_quant(data);

            // Calculate the desired number of clones for the trajectory
            clone_number = calculate_clone_number(thermo_quant, N_clones);
        }

        // Perform cloning of trajectories
    	clone_trajectories(clone_numbers, N_clones);

        // Begin next epoch of cloning algorithm
    	resume_simulations();
    }    
}
```





## Wrapper for Cytosim engine

- More involved that writing a simple script
- Will use script results as a benchmark/comparison for the cloning algorithm results produced by the wrapped Cytosim code
- Writing the wrapper will be a secondary objective for now, will focus on finishing and deploying the script solution



## Planned milestones for next update

- [ ] Complete and test code for calculating trajectory-dependent quantities
- [ ] Complete and test code for cloning/deleting trajectories
- [ ] Design and implement parser for Cytosim output files
